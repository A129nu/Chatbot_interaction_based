# Chatbot_interaction_based
This project is a simple chatbot built in Python, designed to interact with users by providing predefined responses based on their input. It's an excellent starting point for understanding chatbot logic and natural language processing basics.

breakdown of its functionality:

NLTK Setup:

The nltk.download('punkt') ensures that the required NLTK tokenizer resources are downloaded.
Predefined Responses:

The responses dictionary maps specific keywords (like hello, how are you, and bye) to lists of possible responses.
A default response is used for unmatched user inputs.
Response Logic (get_response function):

Converts the user input to lowercase for case-insensitive matching.
Iterates through the predefined keywords in responses.
Returns a random response if a keyword is found in the user input.
Defaults to a generic response if no keywords match.
Chat Loop (chatbot function):

Greets the user and runs an interactive loop.
Continues taking input until the user types "bye."
Calls get_response for each input and prints the response.
How to Run:
Copy the code into a Python environment and execute it.
Interact with the chatbot by typing inputs like "hello," "how are you," or any random text.
Type "bye" to exit the chat.
